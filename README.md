SatAI is an advanced AI agent designed to assist users with sBTC (Stacked Bitcoin) operations. You can connect your preferred wallet to SatAI, enabling seamless interaction with sBTC—just like chatting with a bot. Whether you need to transfer sBTC, check cryptocurrency prices, or analyze sBTC transactions, SatAI makes it effortless.

## Why SatAI?

In the crypto space, most users have a technical background or some level of blockchain knowledge. However, blockchain is a technology that has the potential to create a great impact on society, and it is already making strides in that direction. To truly unlock its potential, we need to make blockchain accessible to everyone, removing technical barriers and making it easy to use.

The first step toward this goal is ensuring that even non-technical users can onboard to blockchain seamlessly. Currently, SatAI depends on external wallets for interaction. For example, if a user wants to send 1 sBTC to another user, they can simply type a natural language command like:

> _Send 1 sBTC to this address._

SatAI will handle the entire transaction setup, preparing all the necessary details, and the user only needs to confirm the transaction. This makes interacting with sBTC as simple as chatting with a friend.
